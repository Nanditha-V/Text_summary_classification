Text Summarization and Classification using Hugging faces pipleline

problem statement:
Every day, people rely on a wide variety of sources to stay informed from news stories to social media posts on topics of their interest. Being able to develop Deeplearning models that can automatically deliver accurate summaries of longer texts by filtering the area of interests is quite essential.

This repository provides an example implementation of text summarization using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and text classification using Zero Shot from Hugging Face. The goal is to demonstrate how to leverage BERT models and Zero Shot classification to perform text summarization and classification tasks on news articles.
